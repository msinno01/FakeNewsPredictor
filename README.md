# Fake News Predictor
In this project I load in a CSV file with Real and Fake news stories which are labelled real and fake.

I then lemmatise the text, vecotrise it with a TF-IDF vectoriser and train a random forest model.

I then make several insights from some of the features of the data and include more of these into my model.

All of the analysis is contained in the notebook [fake_news_classifier.ipynb](fake_news_classifier.ipynb)!
