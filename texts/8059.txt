Listen, it doesn’t matter who wins…the system can not mathematically go on the way it has…..so please dont make it sound like Trump is going to bring it down…and fuck yes…people like me want to see heads roll…they should be rolling for what they have done to this country….politicians, newspeople, celebrities…. all of them. If you or I did what they have done…we would be in Leavenworth in heart beat. Trusy me, it will get worse before it gets better…but when you’re cutting a malignancy out, it’s going to hurt.
