Trump to deport everyone who is not Native American 14-11-16 PRESIDENT-ELECT Donald Trump has confirmed plans to deport 318 million non-Native American immigrants. As part of a wider plan to restore America’s old values of shamanism, living in cone-shaped tents and going on vision quests, Trump will remove anyone who is less than 50 per cent Native American, including his family and himself. He said: “We have forgotten the tribal values that made this nation great. We have lost our connection with nature and no longer even fear the Wendigo, the mighty shape-shifter who comes with the winds. “By 2017 there will be buffalo back on all the plains, Kevin Costner is going to help me and I will scalp anyone who stands in my way.” Trump voter, Martin Bishop said: “This is exactly what we wanted from Trump. “ Kick all the foreigners out, including me, my wife, kids and everyone I know. It’s Brexit plus plus plus.” He added: “The antelope is my spirit animal.”
