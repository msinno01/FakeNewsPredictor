Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States would go nowhere in the Senate, the Republican leader there says.

"We're not gonna follow that suggestion that this particular candidate made," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on "State of the Union."

"It would prevent the president of Afghanistan from coming to the United States. The king of Jordan couldn't come to the United States," he said. "Obviously we're not going to do that."

McConnell had previously criticized Trump's proposal to temporarily block Muslims from entering the United States in the wake of terror attacks in Paris and California.

Despite his rebuke of Trump's proposal, McConnell wouldn't weigh in any further on the presidential race Sunday.
