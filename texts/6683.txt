Next Prev Swipe left/right Unsurprisingly, this Ku Klux Klan leaflet has a spelling mistake The Ku Klux Klan are apparently handing out these leaflets in Louisiana ahead of the US election next week – sadly they’re so consumed with xenophobia they confused “polls” and “poles”. The Ku Klux Klan is distributing these packets in Sabine Parish, LA. Thankfully, they're asking voters go to the poles, not the polls. pic.twitter.com/4sFvFIQ7lB
