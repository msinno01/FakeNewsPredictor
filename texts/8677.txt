Next Swipe left/right Have The Sun really darkened the image of Brexit legal challenge winner Gina Miller? 
@Crookedfootball over on Twitter says, “Look how the Sun has darkened Gina Miller’s skin compared to the Times” 
The Sun: 
The Times: 
Obviously this could be just web bollocks but @Ajjolley has checked the paper versions next to each other: 
“Printed in same plant”, he says, “Little doubt the Sun darkened photo of Gina Miller” 
However @CaeruleanSea says, “as much as I loathe the Sun, the Times have upped the exposure on their pic. Google pics from that speech.”
