Iraq bans alcohol Voltaire Network | 27 October 2016 français Español italiano Deutsch عربي On 22 October 2016, the Iraqi Parliament surreptitiously adopted an amendment to its laws affecting communes which bans the sale, the import and the production of alcohol.
The prohibition was adopted in order to satisfy the Islamists on the day before the liberation of Daesh-occupied Mosul.
The law sets fines of between $8,000 and $20,000 per offence.
Considering that the law is prejudicial to them, the Christians of Iraq (who use wine in the celebration of Mass) have decided to take legal action against the law before a federal tribunal.
