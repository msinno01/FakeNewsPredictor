Three possible Republican presidential candidates called for legal protections for undocumented workers Saturday, contrasting themselves from the rest of the field.

In remarks at the Iowa Ag Summit, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former New York Gov. George Pataki and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also said they support stricter border security, a position in line with the Republican Partyâ€™s conservative base.
