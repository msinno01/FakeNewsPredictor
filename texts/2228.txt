Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker confronted doubts about his foreign-policy acumen during remarks Saturday to a largely sympathetic audience.

At the end of a 45-minute discussion with wealthy conservatives, the moderator referred to complaints that Mr. Walker was “not prepared to speak about foreign policy” at a recent donor meeting in New York, and asked him what he was doing to bone up on the topic.
