‘On Contact’: Chris Hedges and Medea Benjamin on the U.S.-Saudi Alliance   
On this week’s episode of RT’s “On Contact,” Truthdig columnist Chris Hedges and Medea Benjamin, author of “ Kingdom of the Unjust: Behind the US-Saudi Connection ,” explore why Saudi Arabia remains one of the United States’ closest allies in the Middle East despite the monarchy’s record of human rights abuses, including public executions, mistreatment of women, and the promotion of a fundamentalist religion that “sanctifies violence,” as Hedges says. 
RT Correspondent Anya Parampil reviews the long alliance between the two countries.
