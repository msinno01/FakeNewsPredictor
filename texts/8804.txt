Following America’s shock election result, a voter has complained of increasing polarisation in the country between people who agree with her and “ignorant scum”. 
“I just don’t recognise this country any more,” she said sadly. “I remember a time we could discuss things in a civil manner, with everyone being respectful of each other’s opinions.” 
“Nowadays this seems to be impossible, due to the existence of people who obviously must be racist, misogynist knuckle-dragging arsewipes since they disagree with me.” 
She also expressed concern that her political opponents harboured authoritarian tendencies, and said the sooner they were rounded up and put into camps the better “so that a more inclusive and tolerant political discourse can flourish again”. YaBasta
