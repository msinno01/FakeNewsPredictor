The FBI should get the lead out on its investigation over Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, Jane Sanders said Thursday.

During an interview with Neil Cavuto aired Thursday on Fox Business, the wife of Bernie Sanders and one of his closest political advisers also said that the campaign would continue to draw distinctions with Clinton on policy issues and not personal affairs.

Sanders noted that her husband's campaign has said as much from the very beginning of the campaign, particularly after he remarked during the first Democratic debate that the American people are "sick of hearing about your damn emails."

But Jane Sanders also noted that the Democratic candidate said there was a process, remarking that the FBI investigation is going forward.

"We want to let it go through without politicizing it, and then we’ll find out what the situation is. And that’s how we still feel," Sanders said. "I mean, it would be nice if the FBI moved it along," she added, with a laugh.
