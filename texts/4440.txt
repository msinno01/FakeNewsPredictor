Egypt and Saudi Arabia are planning a ground operation in Yemen, Egyptian officials said Thursday, a day after Saudi Arabia began bombing Houthi rebels in the country. Three officials speaking to the AP did not give troop numbers, but said that they would enter by land and by sea and that the coalition would involve other countries. Turkey has said that it may be one of the nations providing "logistical support." Yemeni President Rabbo Mansour Hadi fled his home to an undisclosed location Wednesday. The White House said late Wednesday that President Barack Obama authorized logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi-led operations in Yemen. “While U.S. forces are not taking direct military action in Yemen in support of this effort, we are establishing a Joint Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia to coordinate U.S. military and intelligence support,” according to a White House statement.
