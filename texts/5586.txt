According to the legend, Professor Chi Pu Tei led an expedition into the vast Baian-Kara-Ula Mountains in 1938. The Baian-Kara-Ula Mountains – situated in the wilderness of China – has terrain that is treacherous at best. They discovered a vast cave system during their journey. In them Chi Pu Tei discovered strange circular stone discs that appeared to have a mysterious spiralling message in unknown hieroglyphics. Seven hundred and sixteen were discovered in total, all containing similar symbols and patterns. Tags
