PENNSYLVANIA GUN STORE tells customers “Muslims and Hillary supporters are not welcome” An advertisement for ALTRA FIREARMS warns potential customers that Muslims and supporters of Hillary Clinton, who are “terrorists” in the store’s parlance, are not welcome. âPlease NO Muslims or Hillary Supporters â We do not feel safe selling to terrorists!â Altra Firearms in Jackson Center, Pennsylvania advertised in local papers this week.Â TalkingPointsMemo Â The âPolitically Incorrect Firearmsâ store also invited readers to âVisit our underground bunker and speak with our unique and deplorable sales associates.â Altra Firearms’ owner Paul Chandler, 54, told TPM Friday that heâs had a sign in front of his store advertising that supporters of President Obama arenât welcome to come inside, either. âWe did have, in three-foot letters, âNo radical Muslims,â but I changed that to âNo Muslims,â period,â Chandler said in a phone interview, noting rhetoric from Iranian television motivated the change. âTheyâre saying that America is the great Satan and itâs got to be destroyed. Theyâre basically teaching that if itâs an infidel, either they convert or kill them. And thatâs what theyâre doing in our country now,â he said, comparing the actions of modern Islamic nations to the expansion of Muslim influence into Europe before the Crusades.Â âIf the gun store in Florida wouldnât have sold to that man, thereâs be 40 or 50 more people alive,â he continued, referring to Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people in Orlando when he opened fire in an LGBT nightclub.Â PA gun store ad: "please no Muslims or Hillary supporters.

He also said he’d denied service to one man who told him âI hate niggers, I want a gun.âÂ Chandler said he didnât extend the same blanket ban to potential Christian customers after a series of abortion clinic bombings years ago because âhundreds of Christian preachers got up and said âthat is wrong.â” âDo you hear any Muslim clerics condemning what is going on today?â he asked. âI havenât heard one.â In 2015, designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) sued a different store in Florida ( FLORIDA GUN SUPPLY ) which declared itself a ‘Muslim Free Zone’ but the case was dismissed.
