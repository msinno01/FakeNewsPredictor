New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) hasn't yet said he'll run for president in 2016, but during an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, he didn't seem fazed by the prospect of potentially challenging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

"If I run, I will beat her," Christie said.

Christie said should he run for president, he's confident he could win Pennsylvania, New Mexico and New Hampshire -- three states that voted for President Barack Obama over his 2012 Republican challenger, Mitt Romney.

Christie's currently visiting New Hampshire, though he told Yahoo earlier this week the trip shouldn't be seen as a likely start to a 2016 campaign.

"Whether I decide to run for president or not, ultimately, is something I won't decide until May or June of this year," he said.
