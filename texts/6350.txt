Sharpton Attacks O’Keefe, So O’Keefe Releases Brutal Expose on Sharpton… BOOM! 
If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire, though, MSNBC is by far my favorite — and trust me, a year-and-a-half of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the left-slanting morass. 
MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet — or, at the very least, another culture, a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness. 
This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what I’m talking about perfectly. He had found a mother and daughter in line, apparently for early voting. They were also African-American, which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult, by liberal media standards.   
However, when he asked them about criticism of Trump’s African-American outreach, the mother and daughter blew him out of the water. 
“Well, I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans,” Trina, the daughter, told MSNBC. “He’s trying to address a problem. It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong, and you have a plan that wants to help people.” 
“That’s what a president should do for us. He should reach out and try to help people and address problems that’s going on in our country.” 
“Some of the criticisms have been about (Trump’s pitch to minority voters) ‘What do you have to lose?’” Rascon said to Gloria, the mother. “What do you think about that criticism?”
