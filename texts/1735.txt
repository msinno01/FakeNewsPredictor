President Barack Obama said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server was a mistake, but that U.S. national security hadn’t been endangered. In his first extensive remarks on the controversy that has roiled the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Obama said on CBS’s “60 Minutes” program that questions about Mrs. Clinton’s email arrangement were legitimate. “It is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the American public,” Mr. Obama said.
