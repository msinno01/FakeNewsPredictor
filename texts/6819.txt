Not a day goes by that we donâ€™t miss Andrew Breitbart. But itâ€™s days like today when we really feel his absence and wonder what could have been. Andrew Breitbart was right about a lot of things. But m n was he right about Anthony Weiner

Was he ever. 
As Twitchy told you , the FBI reportedly decided to reopen their probe into Hillary Clinton in light of emails discovered on one of Anthony Weinerâ€™s devices. Tweeters are having a field day, of course. But it will still never come close to perhaps one of the greatest moments in modern media history: Big ups, AB. pic.twitter.com/qMxopaGBo6 
Hereâ€™s the whole thing, because itâ€™s just so fantastic: 
Those were the days, werenâ€™t they? The only sad thing about this Anthony Weiner / HRC insanityâ€¦ It makes me sad Andrew Breitbart is not here to enjoy it. #HillarysEmails

Itâ€™s indeed sad that Breitbart is no longer with us. Still, hopefully we can all draw some comfort in remembering his brilliance â€” and smiling at the thought of him right now. Andrew Breitbart, still doing his thing from beyond. ðŸ™‚
