Donald Trump, who has proposed a moratorium on Muslim immigration into the United States and possible surveillance of mosques, is now talking about "profiling" Muslims as a response to terrorism.

"I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country," Trump said on CBS' Face The Nation.

While adding that "I hate the concept of profiling," Trump said that "we have to start using common sense and we have to use, you know, we have to use our heads."

Profiling is an oft-criticized law enforcement tactic. The National Institute of Justice -- the research and development of the Justice Department -- defined racial profiling as a "practice that targets people for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin."

African-Americans and Hispanics have long protested police profiling that ranges from traffic stops to questioning about alleged crimes.

Trump has stepped up comments about "radical Islamic extremism" in the wake of last week's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and his proposals have drawn criticism from opponents.

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the Muslim migration ban and other proposals would help the Islamic State and other extremists recruit new members, and alienate Muslim nations who are helping the U.S. fight terrorism.

Trump's approach "is un-American," Clinton said last week. "It goes against everything we stand for as a country founded on religious freedom. But it is also dangerous."

In his CBS interview, Trump said Israel and other nations use profiling. "We're not using common sense," he said.
