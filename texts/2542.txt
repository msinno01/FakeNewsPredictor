Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker says that building a wall along the country's norther border with Canada is a legitimate issue that merits further review.

Republican candidates have generally taken a get-tough approach on deterring illegal immigration, but they usually focus on the border with Mexico.

The Wisconsin governor was asked whether he wanted to build a wall on the northern border, too, during an interview Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."

Walker says law enforcement officials in New Hampshire brought up the topic of building a wall along the U.S.-Canadian border during a recent town hall meeting. He says they raised some legitimate concerns, so it's a "legitimate issue for us to look at."

The U.S.-Canada boundary is the longest international border in the world at 5,525 miles long.
