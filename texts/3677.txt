Four students were arrested Saturday after police discovered a shooting plot involving Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif.

Among the evidence, deputies said they found a list of the names of the targeted victims. Tuolumne County Sheriff Jim Mele said the students confessed.

When asked what they said, Mele responded: "that they were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible."

The sheriff's department said they were contacted on Wednesday by school administrators regarding students who were making threats against faculty and staff.

"As each one of them was identified they were removed from campus," Robert Griffith, Summerville Union High School District Superintendent, said. "Their parents were called."

Deputies said the four students were in the beginning stages of the plot, and no one was hurt.

"I can't imagine getting a phone call that something like that had happened at that school," Kristin said.

Deputies said the suspects were in the process of obtaining the weapons they were going to use in the attack.

All four students were arrested for conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons. Their names will not be released because they're juveniles.
