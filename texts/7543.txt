Somehow this isn’t very surprising: No one wants to own approving a $1.7 billion cash transfer to terrorists. https://t.co/375cl78E5V

The Obama administration’s promise of “historic” levels of transparency continues to be a joke, and true to form, AG Loretta Lynch reportedly is doing her part to contribute to that legacy: BIG BREAKING: Attorney General Lynch 'Pleads Fifth' To Congress on Secret Iran 'Ransom' Payments https://t.co/GhwL3QlNqU

The “historic” transparency keeps on coming : 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
Full story here . Would Lynch instead be willing to discuss this in a private airport tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton? Maybe. It's almost as if they have something to hide. https://t.co/n9kIJKSUEW
