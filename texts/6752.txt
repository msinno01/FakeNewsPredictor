On October 27th, 2016, as a result of joint operative-investigative activities between Russian and Turkish intelligence, in Instanbul were arrested leaders and active participants of an underground gang from the North Caucasus region and Crimea, who were hiding from Russian law enforcement on Turkish territory.  
During the course of the operation, representatives of the Crimean branch of Hizb -ut-Tahrir and the North Caucasus wing of ISIS, totaling 80 people, were arrested. 


In line with the agreement with Turkey’s intelligence services, their extradition to Russia is being resolved. 

A high-ranking source in security structures explained to Russian Spring that Turkish intelligence services’ transfer of information on the Crimean Tatar and North Caucasus terrorist network to the Russian side, timed for the meeting between Putin and Erdogan in Sochi, was a gesture of thanks for intelligence warnings about the coup that failed in July, 2016.
