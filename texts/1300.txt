"They're getting more and more desperate. They need to relax a little bit. You know, it's just an election, a campaign. It's like they're freaking out. Calm down, Bush people. It's not that serious," he told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan Tuesday on CNN's "At This Hour."

Kasich, who has staked his hopes a good finish in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, said millions have been spent against him by supporters of his opponents, including Bush.

But the Ohio governor said he is confident that he will do well in the Granite State despite the recent negative ad blitz.

"It's a shame when you see people take the low road to the highest office in the land. But I've decided not to do it," he said. "We feel the momentum. And we'll see what happens. And we'll live with the results. But there will be no regrets in the Kasich campaign for all the work we've put in, the positivity of all of it."

Kasich said he plans on heading to South Carolina following Tuesday's results. "We're going to be changing some snowshoes for some flip-flops and we're going to go from fried clams to jambalaya," he said.
