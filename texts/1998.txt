George P. Bush, the son of former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R), said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that his father is seriously considering a presidential run in 2016.

"I think it's more than likely that he's giving this serious thought in moving forward ... that he'll run," he said.

Bush also said the family "would be behind [Jeb Bush]Â 100 percent if he decides to" run.
