The San Francisco medical examiner's office determined the parts were human remains and the body had been dismembered, Officer Grace Gatpandan said.

"We do have people of interest that homicide investigators are speaking to," she said. Detectives are also reviewing surveillance camera footage and officers are looking for a suspect. She declined to identify the suspect.

The suitcase was found Wednesday afternoon on 11th Street in the Mission District. Police closed four blocks while they investigated.

The Los Angeles Times reported that remains were also found at three locations within a three-block radius. Asked about the reporting, a police spokeswoman told CNN there are no updates.

There were other items around the suitcase, Gatpandan said. The gender and age of the person were unclear, she said.
