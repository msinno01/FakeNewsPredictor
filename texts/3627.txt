The world watched in shock on Wednesday as French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo became the site of a grisly terror attack. Gunmen opened fire on a second-floor editorial meeting, killing 12 people in total. Among them were eight journalists and two police officers.

Journalists felt their profession under fire, and several newspapers are taking to their front pages to react. Editorial cartoons, somber black covers and powerful photos from the attack are seen on pages around the world.

The Independent covers their paper with a fictional cover of Charlie Hebdo.

Lib√©ration in Paris said "We are all Charlie."

The Times of London's calls it "attack on freedom."
