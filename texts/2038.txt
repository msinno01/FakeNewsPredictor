A new poll released Monday indicates Hillary Clinton holds an advantage over five potential Republican opponents in hypothetical match-ups for the 2016 presidential election.

If the contest were held today, 45% of likely voters say they would pick the former secretary of state over Mitt Romney, who garners 39%.

She has a 43%-37% advantage over former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a 42%-36% margin over New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

All three of Clinton's margins over Bush, Christie and Romney fall within the sampling error of plus-or-minus 3.6 percentage points.

When matched against Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, however, her lead widens. Forty-six percent of likely voters side with Clinton, compared to 33% who pick Cruz.

In a head-to-head with Paul, who's been aggressive in reaching out to Democrats and independents, Clinton still comes out ahead, 45%-37%.

Bloomberg conducted interview with 753 likely voters from December 3-5.
