Clinton, who resigned from her philanthropy's board of directors immediately after declaring her presidential campaign on Sunday, has drawn fire for her family foundation's acceptance of money from countries considered hostile to the United States.

The Foundation will now only accept funding from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, according to new foundation policies that will be posted online but was obtained by CNN.

The foundation also pledges to disclose its donors quarterly beginning in July -- as opposed to annually -- and to not hold any more Clinton Global Initiative events overseas following an international conference in May.
