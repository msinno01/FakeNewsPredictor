To tackle growing obesity rates, diets need to include more omega-3 fatty acids and fewer omega-6s, according to a new report published in the online journal Open Heart. 
The group of experts believe a better balance of omega-3 and -6 in the diet is a more effective way of improving health than current nutrition policies, which focus on calories and energy expenditure and have “failed miserably over the past 30 years,” say Dr. Artemis Simopoulos of the Center for Genetics, Nutrition, and Health, Washington DC, and Dr. James DiNicolantonio of Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas. 
But technological advances and modern farming methods have changed the omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio in the typical Western diet.
