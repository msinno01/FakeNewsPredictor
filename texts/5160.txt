Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared to have made inroads with evangelical voters after meeting with hundreds of conservative Christian leaders Tuesday, but not all Christians are in his corner.

Religion News Service came out with a list of seven conservative Christian leaders who are not supporting Trump.

Topping their list is Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. Moore referred to Trump's campaign as "reality television moral sewage."

The report also named Denny Burk, a professor of biblical studies at Boyce College. Burk blogged in March, "I am not joking or being hyperbolic when I say that he is a Mussolini-in-waiting. He must never be allowed near the Oval Office. Ever."

In a February blog, pastor and author Max Lucado wrote that Trump would not make it through the "decency interview" he requires for those who date his daughters.

"Can we not expect a tone that would set a good example for our children?" he wrote. "We stand against bullying in schools. Shouldn't we do the same in presidential politics?"

RNS also listed Thabiti Anyabwile, pastor of Anacostia River Church; conservative blogger Erick Erickson; Robbie George, McCormick professor of jurisprudence at Princeton University; and Alan Noble, editor of the website Christ and Pop Culture.
