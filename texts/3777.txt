Michael Brown’s parents plan to bring a civil lawsuit for the wrongful death of their son against Darren Wilson and the city of Ferguson, Missouri. The announcment came a day after the Justice Department released its report on the abuses of the city’s police department and said Wilson wouldn’t be charged for violating Brown’s civil rights. Brown family lawyers note that the burden of proof is lower in a civil case than the criminal cases that were considered by both the federal government and a St. Louis County grand jury.
