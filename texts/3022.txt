There's been a lot of complaining this election cycle about the "rigged" rules of the game, and not without reason: Our presidential primary process can be a confusing, undemocratic mess.

It's also incredibly difficult to figure out how to improve. On this episode of The Weeds, with Sarah Kliff still on vacation, Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias wrestle with just why so many voters feel frustrated by the primaries, whether that represents a genuine danger to trust in government, and what, if anything, can be done to make the system fairer.

Our Weeds hosts also explain a new regulatory initiative that could save the middle class billions — yay, fiduciary rules! They also look at some new research on media consumption and polarization, and discuss how it may or may not relate to the Donald Trump supporter on Matt's Facebook feed.
