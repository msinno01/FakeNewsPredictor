The US should get rid of the illusion that there is the possibility of “taming” terrorists, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated.  
“Terrorism is like a snake: you turn your back on it and it bites you. Don’t play with it,” she said in an interview to China Radio International. 
Zakharova remarked that Western and regional countries have invested a lot of forces and means in terrorist groupings. 
“But these are terrorists, and they shouldn’t be flirted with,” Zakharova added. 
In the diplomat’s opinion, the actions of the American side, which is not allowing Jebat Al-Nusra to be destroyed, “are a clear manifestation of the fact that they are protecting it.”  

Zakharova also noted that this is not the first time that Russia is clashing with such an approach by the US.
