Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump landed his first major newspaper endorsement Sunday as the Las Vegas Review-Journal proclaimed its support for the embattled nominee.

 

 "History tells us that agents for reform often generate fear and alarm among those intent on preserving their cushy sinecures," the paper said.

"Itâ€™s hardly a shock, then, that the 2016 campaign has produced a barrage of unceasing vitriol directed toward Mr. Trump. But let us not be distracted by the social media sideshows and carnival clatter. Substantive issues are in play this November," it stated.

 

 The Review-Journal represented Trump's first endorsement from a major newspaper, most of which have backed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, or simply opposed the real estate tycoon. The Review-Journal is owned by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who reportedly has become disillusioned with Trump.

Dozens of major newspapers have endorsed Clinton. Trump was the only major-party candidate without a major paper endorsement until Saturday.
