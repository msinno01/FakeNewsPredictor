Republican presidential candidate John Kasich reaffirmed his call for a path to legal status for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., as well as a guest worker program to meet the needs of the labor market.

On CNN’s “State of the Union” show on Sunday morning, the Ohio governor seemed to disavow his previous support for eliminating “birthright citizenship,” the law granting automatic U.S. citizenship to almost all children born on U.S. soil.

“I don’t think we need to go there,” he said.
