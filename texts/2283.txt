Marco Rubio said Sunday that he believes sexual orientation isn't a choice, but he is opposed to courts deciding on marriage for same-sex couples.

"I believe that sexual preference is something that people are born with," he said on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Rubio also said that he believes marriage should be "between one man and one woman" but insisted "it's not that I'm against gay marriage."

"States have always regulated marriage, and if a state wants to have a different definition, you should petition the state legislature and have a political debate," he said. "I don't think courts should be making that decision, and I don't believe same-sex marriage is a constitutional right."
